1. Bread - You can make Garlic Bread with any bread you choose. But for a Dominos/Pizza Hut copycat (my favourite!), use a basic bakery French stick / baguette.
French Sticks (baguettes) in Australia is usually around 60 cm / 2 ft long with a diameter of 7 - 9 cm / 2.7 - 3.5".
2. Garlic flavour will reduce slightly once cooked, it's harsh when raw
3. Nutrition per serving.
