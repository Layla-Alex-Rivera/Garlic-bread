Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
Cut the French stick in half. Then cut the bread almost all the way through into 2cm / 4/5" thick slices.
Mix together the butter, garlic, salt and parsley. Taste to see if it's salty / garlicky enough for your taste (Note 2).
Smear garlic butter over cut side of bread (Note 2).
Smear remaining butter on the top and sides of the bread.
Wrap each bread in foil.
Bake for 15 minutes until the crust is crispy (check through foil).
Unwrap and serve!
